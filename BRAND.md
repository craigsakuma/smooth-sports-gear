## 2. Brand Story

Tom Iliffe founded West Coast Athletics in 1986 in Gualala, CA. For nearly 40 years it has been the primary source of uniforms, warm-ups, and spirit wear for Point Arena High School (the Pirates), Arena Elementary, and local youth programs across football, volleyball, basketball, soccer, and baseball.

Tom also coached — varsity football assistant at PAHS starting in 2002, JV head coach from 2010, and varsity head coach through the 2015 season. He coached volleyball, little league, and youth basketball as well.

His philosophy: **every kid deserves a real uniform, regardless of what their family can afford.** He regularly donated gear, cleats, socks, and equipment to Arena Elementary so no child ever missed out due to cost. He ran clinics to bridge elementary and high school sports. His work frequently blurred the line between business and community service.

He has emphysema and stepped back from coaching. The website is being built as a surprise gift to help grow the business so Tom can keep doing what he loves.

### Core narrative themes:
- **Nearly 40 years** — not a startup, not a franchise
- **No kid left on the sideline** — donated gear, at-cost pricing, genuine care
- **Coach's perspective** — built by someone who understood what teams actually need
- **Community institution** — the whole community has relied on Tom for four decades
- **Small-town Mendocino Coast identity** — Gualala, Point Arena, the Pirates
- **Expansion with heart** — same care, broader reach

### Key programs served:
- Point Arena High School (football, volleyball, basketball game uniforms, warm-ups, "Pirate Pride" spirit wear)
- Arena Elementary (basketball, soccer — uniforms at cost/donated; equipment donations; sports clinics)
- Point Arena Little League
- Youth basketball (middle school level, community clinics)

### The "no kid benched" detail:
Tom donated cleats, socks, balls, and uniforms to ensure no child sat out due to financial barriers. This is the single most powerful brand differentiator — use it prominently in copy and story.

### Family legacy:
- **Dan Iliffe** — Tom's son, eventually became Varsity Head Football Coach at Point Arena
- For many seasons Tom and Dan were a **father-son coaching duo** — Tom as assistant/advisor, Dan as head coach
- Tom was famous for his **halftime inspirational speeches** — a local institution
- 2016: Dan fully took over the varsity program — Tom passed the torch to his son
- Dan also coached basketball and assisted with other school programs
- The Iliffe name is synonymous with PAHS athletics

### Recognition:
- **Point Arena HS Athletic Recognition**: honored multiple times for "Lifetime of Service" — plaques, homecoming ceremonies
- **Independent Coast Observer**: frequently highlighted as a pillar of the South Coast community; informal "Citizen of the Year"-style mentions for Little League and Arena Elementary work
- **West Coast Athletics shop**: walls lined with decades of team photos, championship banners, and memorabilia — a walk-in hall of fame
- Tom helped **standardize the Point Arena Pirate logo** on uniforms
- A generation of athletes he coached now coach their own children

### Key copy note — the 2016 transition:
Tom did not simply step down or get replaced. He **handed the program to his son**. This is a legacy story, not a retirement story. Frame it that way.

## 4. Brand Personality

The brand should feel like **a trusted community member, not a vendor**.

| Trait | What it means in practice |
|---|---|
| **Warm** | Personal, approachable — feels like talking to the coach |
| **Proud** | Small-town and coastal identity worn with confidence |
| **Reliable** | 30 years means something — dependable, consistent, experienced |
| **Crafted** | Not mass-produced — made with care and attention |
| **Community-first** | The business exists because of and for the community |

### What it is NOT:
- Corporate / slick / generic
- Aggressive / hyped (no "UNLEASH YOUR INNER CHAMPION" energy)
- Cheap-feeling
- Trying to look like a national brand

---

## 5. Voice & Tone

**Voice:** Personal, direct, warm. Written as the owner speaking, not a marketing department.

**Tone varies by context:**
- **Hero / headlines:** Bold, proud, confident — short punchy statements
- **Story section:** Personal, conversational, genuine — first person ("I've been coaching...")
- **Product descriptions:** Clear and helpful — what it is, who it's for
- **Contact section:** Inviting, low-pressure — "I personally respond to every inquiry"

**Write like:** A coach you've known for years — someone you trust, who knows your team's name.

**Avoid:** Corporate-speak ("solutions," "synergy," "leverage"), hype language, exclamation points everywhere.

---

## 6. Design Principles

1. **The site is a backdrop, not the show.** Products come in every color and design — the site must never compete with them. Clean, neutral, generous whitespace.
2. **The story is the differentiator.** Anyone can print jerseys. Nobody else has 30 years coaching Point Arena football. Lead with the human.
3. **Humble confidence.** The design should feel earned, not flashy. No hype. Let the work speak.
4. **Community over corporate.** Small-town Mendocino Coast identity is an asset. Lean into it.

## 7. Visual Identity

### Logo Treatment
The logo pairs two fonts intentionally:
- **"Smooth"** — *Great Vibes* script (cursive, flowing, personal, handcrafted feel)
- **"Sports Gear"** — *Bebas Neue* display (bold, athletic, structured)

This mirrors the *Smooth Prints* parent brand logo and should be preserved across all materials.

### Typography

| Role | Font | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Brand script | Great Vibes | "Smooth" in logo only |
| Display / headlines | Bebas Neue | Section titles, stats, callouts |
| Body | Inter | All paragraph text, labels, UI |

### Color Palette — RECOMMENDED

Because products come in every color, the site must be a clean neutral canvas.
Bright, saturated backgrounds compete with photos. The palette below lets photos breathe.

**Recommended: Warm Neutral**

| Role | Color | Hex | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dark (hero, footer, nav) | Warm charcoal | `#1e1e1e` | Neutral — doesn't fight any product color |
| Accent | Amber gold | `#c8882a` | Warm, earned, craftsman — evokes stadium lights and championship trophies |
| Background (light sections) | Warm white | `#fafaf8` | Slightly warm so photos sit naturally, not sterile |
| Card background | White | `#ffffff` | Pure white for product cards — maximum photo clarity |
| Body text | Warm dark gray | `#2c2c2e` | Softer than pure black, easier to read |
| Muted text | Medium gray | `#6b6b6b` | Secondary text, captions |

**Why not the current navy + orange:**
Navy and bright orange are fine for a corporate sports brand but they fight colorful product photos and feel generic. Warm charcoal + amber is distinctive, neutral enough for any product color, and feels crafted and authentic — matching the owner's personality.

## 7. Photography Direction (for when photos are added)

- **Hero photo:** Action shot or team celebration — real athletes, real moments (not stock)
- **Product photos:** Clean, bright, on a neutral or team-colored background
- **Gallery:** A mix of finished products AND teams wearing them — the people matter as much as the gear
- **Owner photo:** Candid / approachable — on the field, with a team, not a studio headshot
- **Mood:** Genuine, local, community — not polished to the point of feeling corporate
