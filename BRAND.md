## 2. Brand Story

The owner has coached the Point Arena High School football team for decades in Gualala, CA — a tight-knit community on the Mendocino Coast. What started as making uniforms for his own team grew organically into outfitting teams across the community: little league, rec leagues, high schools, traveling teams, and sports parents.

This is not a corporate printing operation. It is one person who has shown up for the community for 30+ years — first as a coach, then as the person who makes sure every athlete looks the part.

Now the business is expanding to serve neighboring communities within a couple hours' drive.

### Core narrative themes:
- **Decades of community service** — not a startup, not a franchise
- **Personal attention** — the owner handles every order
- **Sports coaching roots** — understands athletes and teams from the inside
- **Small-town pride** — Mendocino Coast identity is an asset, not a limitation
- **Expansion with heart** — growing without losing the personal touch

| Segment | Description |
|---|---|
| **Youth coaches** | Little league, rec league, youth football — need affordable, quality uniforms fast |
| **High school athletic directors / coaches** | Varsity-level quality, multiple sports, spirit wear |
| **Traveling team organizers** | Tournament-ready, cohesive kits, often parents running the show |
| **Sports parents** | Fan gear, keepsakes, custom gifts for their athlete |
| **Booster clubs** | Fundraiser shirts, sponsor signs, event banners |
| **New communities** | Teams within ~2 hours of Gualala who don't have a local source like this |

## 4. Brand Personality

The brand should feel like **a trusted community member, not a vendor**.

| Trait | What it means in practice |
|---|---|
| **Warm** | Personal, approachable — feels like talking to the coach |
| **Proud** | Small-town and coastal identity worn with confidence |
| **Reliable** | 30 years means something — dependable, consistent, experienced |
| **Crafted** | Not mass-produced — made with care and attention |
| **Community-first** | The business exists because of and for the community |

### What it is NOT:
- Corporate / slick / generic
- Aggressive / hyped (no "UNLEASH YOUR INNER CHAMPION" energy)
- Cheap-feeling
- Trying to look like a national brand

## 5. Voice & Tone

**Voice:** Personal, direct, warm. Written as the owner speaking, not a marketing department.

**Tone varies by context:**
- **Hero / headlines:** Bold, proud, confident — short punchy statements
- **Story section:** Personal, conversational, genuine — first person ("I've been coaching...")
- **Product descriptions:** Clear and helpful — what it is, who it's for
- **Contact section:** Inviting, low-pressure — "I personally respond to every inquiry"

**Write like:** A coach you've known for years — someone you trust, who knows your team's name.

**Avoid:** Corporate-speak ("solutions," "synergy," "leverage"), hype language, exclamation points everywhere.

## 6. Design Principles

1. **The site is a backdrop, not the show.** Products come in every color and design — the site must never compete with them. Clean, neutral, generous whitespace.
2. **The story is the differentiator.** Anyone can print jerseys. Nobody else has 30 years coaching Point Arena football. Lead with the human.
3. **Humble confidence.** The design should feel earned, not flashy. No hype. Let the work speak.
4. **Community over corporate.** Small-town Mendocino Coast identity is an asset. Lean into it.

## 7. Visual Identity

### Logo Treatment
The logo pairs two fonts intentionally:
- **"Smooth"** — *Great Vibes* script (cursive, flowing, personal, handcrafted feel)
- **"Sports Gear"** — *Bebas Neue* display (bold, athletic, structured)

This mirrors the *Smooth Prints* parent brand logo and should be preserved across all materials.

### Typography

| Role | Font | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Brand script | Great Vibes | "Smooth" in logo only |
| Display / headlines | Bebas Neue | Section titles, stats, callouts |
| Body | Inter | All paragraph text, labels, UI |

### Color Palette — RECOMMENDED

Because products come in every color, the site must be a clean neutral canvas.
Bright, saturated backgrounds compete with photos. The palette below lets photos breathe.

**Recommended: Warm Neutral**

| Role | Color | Hex | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dark (hero, footer, nav) | Warm charcoal | `#1e1e1e` | Neutral — doesn't fight any product color |
| Accent | Amber gold | `#c8882a` | Warm, earned, craftsman — evokes stadium lights and championship trophies |
| Background (light sections) | Warm white | `#fafaf8` | Slightly warm so photos sit naturally, not sterile |
| Card background | White | `#ffffff` | Pure white for product cards — maximum photo clarity |
| Body text | Warm dark gray | `#2c2c2e` | Softer than pure black, easier to read |
| Muted text | Medium gray | `#6b6b6b` | Secondary text, captions |

**Why not the current navy + orange:**
Navy and bright orange are fine for a corporate sports brand but they fight colorful product photos and feel generic. Warm charcoal + amber is distinctive, neutral enough for any product color, and feels crafted and authentic — matching the owner's personality.

## 7. Photography Direction (for when photos are added)

- **Hero photo:** Action shot or team celebration — real athletes, real moments (not stock)
- **Product photos:** Clean, bright, on a neutral or team-colored background
- **Gallery:** A mix of finished products AND teams wearing them — the people matter as much as the gear
- **Owner photo:** Candid / approachable — on the field, with a team, not a studio headshot
- **Mood:** Genuine, local, community — not polished to the point of feeling corporate
